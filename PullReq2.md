I have been reading documentation on the [Swift](https://swift.org/) website
Trying to get familiar with how swift is tested has helped me better understand the language 
and reading the documentation helps a lot.

I have had some issues with my computer this week which has set me back a bit on testing, 
which is why i'm submitting a document this week.

The following has helped me get more familiar with the project, i find they are useful to what i 
need to do.

	- [Swift Compiler](https://swift.org/compiler-stdlib/#compiler-architecture)  

	- [Swift Grammar](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/zzSummaryOfTheGrammar.html) 

	- [unit testing](https://clean-swift.com/effective-unit-testing/)  

	- [Swift Debugger LLDB](https://github.com/apple/swift-lldb)  

	- [Testing](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/ContinuousIntegration.md)
