I have been getting a bit more familiar with Github and Git since it is confusing.
I understand the basics of swift as it is familiar to other languages with some distinct differences.
Swift is heavily tested so I have been looking at their tests to get familiar with how to approach the project 
and start testing. 
I have also been looking through the swift documentation on their website which helps explain how they test the language and how to get started with it.
